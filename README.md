## 😤 Struggles Faced

Let's keep it real — this project was a **battle**.

- ❌ TypeScript errors that made no sense  
- ❌ ESLint crying over small stuff  
- ❌ Turbopack not playing nice with configs  
- ❌ Next.js 15 experimental changes tripping builds  
- ❌ Hours wasted fixing "tiny" issues that broke everything

> I even had to add `ignoreBuildErrors` and `ignoreDuringBuilds` just to push this through.  
> But hey — **it’s live, it works, and I learned a ton.**

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Don’t trust error messages at face value — they lie.
- Turbopack is fast... until it's not.
- shadcn/ui is great, but you need to tweak for custom layouts.
- Small config changes can break the whole build.  
- Sometimes you just need to ship it and refactor later.
